                        Everyday Vitamin had just put in an order for the latest set of fad drugs from weight loss giant, Metabolic Nutrition. They wanted a campaign to advertise these new drugs to their customer base, as well as needing a new advert for their Clicksor campaign.

                        <p>I started with research on Metabolic Nutrition's new drugs. I needed to know the target audience.</p>
                        <p>I noticed that most of Metabolic Nutrition's marketing was geared towards athletic and fit customers who would already have some idea of which products work for them. I decided instead to focus on the everyman. The general public has no idea which nutrition products are best for themselves. I decided to focus on something they would have some familiarity to: their own personal preferences. I utilized a friendly design to make users feel that they had a choice in what they put in their body.</p>
                        <p>For the Clicksor ad campaign, I tried to focus on Everyday Vitamin's vast inventory and availability. The allure to the customer is the idea that no matter what they need, we'll be able to provide.</p>
