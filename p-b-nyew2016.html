                    EnerKnol was in need of an update to their branding material for their annual industry event, New York Energy Week. They wanted a solution that would highlight the event, as well as pointing back to the parent company. Their requirements included maintaining the logo designs and branding colors.

                    Solution
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                <p>I started with EnerKnol's requirements for the logo designs and branding colors.</p>
                <p>I chose a t-shirt in the same navy color as the New York Energy Week logo, to save on printing colors and costs. I proceeded to sketch out possible designs that would point to the idea that the event was taking place in New York City and finalized a design that included a part of the New York City skyline that would act as a mirror image of the logo. This gave the t-shirt a look that would make passers-by look twice. On the back of the shirt, I wanted to point to the idea that EnerKnol dealt with energy information management. I finalized a design that resembled a battery, in the colors of the EnerKnol logo. The shirt was printed and was offered to visitors of the event from June 13 to 17.</p>
                <p>I utilized a similar design for the booklet, access passes, and app cards to give a sense of familiarity to the visitors as they receive each item. The delivering of these materials would be staggered so I felt it was important that visitors understood that this was associated with the event and not a random circular from a third party.</p>
                <p>The banners created were placed in various locations around the events' host buildings to lead visitors to the correct conference rooms where talks were held. Strategic locations chosen included the front lobby, the hallway leading out of the elevator bank, and beside the door of said conference room.</p>
